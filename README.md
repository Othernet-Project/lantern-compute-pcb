# lantern-compute-pcb
The files in this repo pertain to Lantern's main PCB. This includes the schematic, gerbers, and BOM, in addition to project outputs from Altrium 15. 

Lantern is a portable satellite data receiver which consists of a main compute board and separate RF module which receives satellite transmissions between 1525MHz and 1559MHz. 

V1 of the Lantern compute pcb is derived from the Beaglebone Black single board computer. The main differences between V1 and BBB include the addition of a DVB-S2 network interface module (NIM), as well as an onboard wifi module. Unlike the BBB, V1 does not provide for a video interface.
